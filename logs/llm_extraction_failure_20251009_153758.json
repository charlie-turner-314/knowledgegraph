Your task is to read source text and produce structured knowledge as subject–predicate–object triples, enriched with ontology types, attributes, and tags.\n\nGuidelines\n1. Canonical Normalization\nNormalize entity wording to the most common canonical label when synonyms or variants appear.\nExample: Treat \"Artificial intelligence\", \"AI\", and \"A.I.\" as the same concept → canonical label: \"Artificial intelligence\".\n\n2. Granularity & Hierarchy\nPrefer atomic concepts for subjects and objects.\nIf a phrase contains multiple ideas (e.g., \"blasting and re-entry cycles\"), split into 2 separate objects, with a relationship indicating is_cycle:\nFor abstract concepts (e.g., \"Innovation areas\"), create a parent node and link specific items using is_a or part_of.\nSubjects should NOT CONTAIN the word 'and' unless very confident it is part of an entity name.\nVerbs are reserved for relationships or attributes. \n\n3. Node vs Relationship Roles\nDo not emit verb phrases as subjects or objects unless they represent a named process.\nModel actions as predicates or attributes (e.g., Excavation machine — uses — TBM).\nObjects and subjects should be domain-specific entities - not abstract concepts. \n\n4. Deduplication & Semantic Merge\nMerge semantically equivalent concepts before emitting triples.\nExample: \"Automated extraction level development\" and \"Extraction level development automation\" → canonical: \"Extraction level development automation\".\n\n5. Ontology Class Assignment\nAlways attempt to assign subject_type and object_type from the provided ontology when confident.\nIf uncertain, leave null but include suggested_subject_label and suggested_object_label.\n\n6. Attributes\nExtract measurable or descriptive attributes (e.g., rate, safety level, automation type) and attach them to the relevant entity.\nDo not embed attributes in the label.\n\n7. Tags\nInclude domain-relevant tags (e.g., \"safety\", \"productivity\", \"automation\") whenever context suggests relevance.\n\n8. Canonical Vocabulary\nIf canonical vocabulary is supplied for a concept, strictly use provided labels.\nIf no match exists, emit best available wording and set suggested_* fields.\n\n9. **IMPORTANT** Output Structure\n\n  {\n    \"triples\": [\n      {\n        \"subject\": \"<canonical label>\",\n        \"predicate\": \"<verb or relation>\",\n        \"object\": \"<canonical label>\",\n        \"subject_type\": \"<ontology entity type for subject>\",\n        \"object_type\": \"<ontology entity type for object>\",\n        \"confidence\": <0-1 float, optional>,\n        \"source_reference\": \"<page/section ref>\",\n        \"suggested_subject_label\": \"<canonical suggestion>\",\n        \"suggested_object_label\": \"<canonical suggestion>\",\n        \"subject_attributes\": [\n          { \"name\": <attribute name>, \"value\": <attribute value> }\n        ],\n        \"object_attributes\": [\n          { \"name\": <attribute name>, \"value\": <attribute value> }\n        ],\n        \"tags\": [\"<label>\", ...]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nEnsure no duplicate subjects or objects appear without unique predicates.\n\n10. Fact Integrity\nEmit only facts supported by the provided text. Do not invent information.\n\n**Return ONLY the JSON. No description, no markdown.**"

Central themes include automation, innovation, step-change performance, and productivity improvements across existing value chains and mining operations like the Olympic Dam (OD) Deeps and Oak Dam. The document details strategic initiatives such as future concentrator developments, ore-sorting technologies to increase copper head grades and reduce capital intensity, and accelerated block cave ramp-ups to reduce brownfield timelines and capital costs. It emphasizes leveraging trusted partnerships, talent, and disruptive systems that reduce workforce requirements post-2035. Key mining methods include sublevel caving and block caving, with potential multi-cave developments and bulk mining unlocking operational cost reduction and growth. The journey to OD Deeps aims to integrate early-fit solutions within CuSA mining operations, including Carra and Olympic Dam block caves, to deliver step-change growth driven by automation and remote mining technologies. The total un-risked SBO NPV specifically attributed to Copper SA strategy-aligned opportunities is around US$6.6 billion."
