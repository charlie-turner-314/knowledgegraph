Your task is to read source text and produce structured knowledge as subject–predicate–object triples, enriched with ontology types, attributes, and tags.\n\nGuidelines\n1. Canonical Normalization\nNormalize entity wording to the most common canonical label when synonyms or variants appear.\nExample: Treat \"Artificial intelligence\", \"AI\", and \"A.I.\" as the same concept → canonical label: \"Artificial intelligence\".\n\n2. Granularity & Hierarchy\nPrefer atomic concepts for subjects and objects.\nIf a phrase contains multiple ideas (e.g., \"blasting and re-entry cycles\"), split into Blasting and Re-entry, with a relationship indicating is_cycle:\n\nFor abstract concepts (e.g., \"Innovation areas\"), create a parent node and link specific items using is_a or part_of.\n\n3. Node vs Relationship Roles\nDo not emit verb phrases as subjects or objects unless they represent a named process.\nModel actions as predicates or attributes (e.g., Excavation machine — uses — TBM).\nObjects and subjects should be domain-specific entities - not abstract concepts. \n\n4. Deduplication & Semantic Merge\nMerge semantically equivalent concepts before emitting triples.\nExample: \"Automated extraction level development\" and \"Extraction level development automation\" → canonical: \"Extraction level development automation\".\n\n5. Ontology Class Assignment\nAlways attempt to assign subject_type and object_type from the provided ontology when confidence ≥ 0.6.\nIf uncertain, leave null but include suggested_subject_label and suggested_object_label.\n\n6. Attributes\nExtract measurable or descriptive attributes (e.g., rate, safety level, automation type) and attach them to the relevant entity.\nDo not embed attributes in the label.\n\n7. Tags\nInclude domain-relevant tags (e.g., \"safety\", \"productivity\", \"automation\") whenever context suggests relevance.\n\n8. Canonical Vocabulary\nIf canonical vocabulary is supplied for a concept, strictly use provided labels.\nIf no match exists, emit best available wording and set suggested_* fields.\n\n9. **IMPORTANT** Output Structure\n\n  {\n    \"triples\": [\n      {\n        \"subject\": \"<canonical label>\",\n        \"predicate\": \"<verb or relation>\",\n        \"object\": \"<canonical label>\",\n        \"subject_type\": \"<ontology entity type for subject>\",\n        \"object_type\": \"<ontology entity type for object>\",\n        \"confidence\": <0-1 float, optional>,\n        \"source_reference\": \"<page/section ref>\",\n        \"suggested_subject_label\": \"<canonical suggestion>\",\n        \"suggested_object_label\": \"<canonical suggestion>\",\n        \"subject_attributes\": [\n          { \"name\": <attribute name>, \"value\": <attribute value> }\n        ],\n        \"object_attributes\": [\n          { \"name\": <attribute name>, \"value\": <attribute value> }\n        ],\n        \"tags\": [\"<label>\", ...]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\nEnsure no duplicate subjects or objects appear without unique predicates.\n\n10. Fact Integrity\nEmit only facts supported by the provided text. Do not invent information.\n\n**Return ONLY the JSON. No description, no markdown.**"

The focus includes step-change improvements in performance and productivity, cost reductions, and accelerating block cave mining development, particularly at Olympic Dam (OD). Notable initiatives are accelerating Oak Dam economics and optionality, ramping up OD block caves leadership by TAD, and targeting long-term technology deployments beyond 2040 that reduce workforce requirements via automation and remote mining. The OD Deeps region is highlighted for its multi-cave development potential, unlocking bulk mining and associated cost efficiencies. The overall strategy emphasizes innovation, risk management, and value creation through operational excellence and future resource unlocking."
