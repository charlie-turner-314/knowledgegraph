Your job is to read source text and produce structured knowledge as subject–predicate–object triples.\n\nGuidelines:\n- Always normalise entity wording to the canonical label when synonyms or variants appear. Treat aliases such as \"Artificial intelligence\", \"AI\", and \"A.I.\" as the same concept and emit the most common canonical label.\n- Predicates must be at most three words and express a clear relation.\n- Attributes should be included where contextual information can assist (e.g metrics, conditions, valuations)\n- Provide optional \"tags\" array for the triple when categorical labels (e.g., \"safety\", \"financial\") help downstream filtering.\n- Only emit facts supported by the provided text. Do not invent information.\n\n- Return valid JSON conforming to this schema:\n  {\n    \"triples\": [\n      {\n        \"subject\": \"<canonical label>\",\n        \"predicate\": \"<verb or relation>\",\n        \"object\": \"<canonical label>\",\n        \"subject_type\": \"<ontology entity type for subject>\",\n        \"object_type\": \"<ontology entity type for object>\",\n        \"confidence\": <0-1 float, optional>,\n        \"source_reference\": \"<page/section ref>\",\n        \"suggested_subject_label\": \"<canonical suggestion>\",\n        \"suggested_object_label\": \"<canonical suggestion>\",\n        \"subject_attributes\": [\n          { \"name\": <attribute name>, \"value\": <attribute value> }\n        ],\n        \"object_attributes\": [\n          { \"name\": <attribute name>, \"value\": <attribute value> }\n        ],\n        \"tags\": [\"<label>\", ...]\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n- When a canonical vocabulary is supplied, prefer the provided labels and use aliases only for matching.\n- When abstract entities are present, use common sense to link back to the absolute entity or entities that the source is focused on. E.g. \"Less-regulated mine\" is not an entity itself, it is a \"mine\" with lower than normal \"regulation\" attribute.\n- Prefer short subjects and objects, creating new nodes or attaching attributes for supporting information. subjects and objects SHOULD NOT have 'and' or 'from' or 'or' in their label, unless semantically valid in the canonical term. \n- Create a parent subject and use 'is_a' relationships to join subjects if required. \n- Always supply subject_type and object_type when they can be confidently assigned (0.6+ confidence) from context or ontology; otherwise omit the field or leave it null (do NOT guess).\n- If no canonical match exists, still emit the best available wording and set the suggested_* fields to your recommended canonical label.\n- Return ONLY the JSON, with **NO description** and **NO markdown**. Your reponse should directly be valid JSON."

The current section centers on Olympic Dam (OD) Deeps and broader Copper SA (CuSA) mining operations, emphasizing initiatives to improve productivity, reduce costs, and accelerate mining project timelines through automation, innovation, and technology. Significant emphasis is placed on step-change performance by leveraging ore-sorting, block caving, and future concentrator developments across 2030-2040 horizons. Key projects include accelerating OD block caves to reduce brownfield-to-production timelines and improving Oak Dam economics to cut capital costs. The OD Deeps project aims to unlock multi-cave bulk mining with lower operational costs and enable growth via automation and remote mining technologies. Future resource expansion includes sites like Olympic Dam Open Cut, Free Doctor, Khamsin, and Carra Resources. The journey towards OD Deeps is framed as transformational, enabling earlier application of innovative solutions across CuSA's current operations. Overall, the strategy integrates technological advancements and partnerships to realize growth beyond 2040 with a focus on reducing workforce requirements and capital intensity."
